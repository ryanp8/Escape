# Escape

Python code used to prototype raycasting implementation in Escape, my final project game for Northwestern's CS 211 course.
In the game, a player is placed in a map with obstacles and must find four checkpoints before the door out of the maze is unlocked.

The final game is coded in C++ using Northwestern's ge211 game engine, but the code can't be made public.
